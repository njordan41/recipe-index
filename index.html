          “The Silver Spoon was the first English edition of the bestselling
          Italian cookbook of the last fifty years, Il cucchiaio d'argento. With
          over 2,000 recipes, its simple style and authenticity has made it the
          definitive book on Italian cooking, for both gourmets and beginners.
          Following its phenomenal success, this new updated and revised edition
          is illustrated with newly commissioned photography and includes new
          menus by celebrated Italian chefs.”

          <h4>Personal Note:</h4>
          This one’s slightly intimidating since it’s so dense but it’s become
          an inspiration index for an ingredient I’m not sure how to cook.

          <h4>About This Cookbook:</h4>
          “From the world-renowned sommelier Aldo Sohm, a dynamic, essential
          wine guide for a new generation. Aldo Sohm is one of the most
          respected and widely lauded sommeliers in the world. He has worked
          with chef Eric Ripert as wine director of Le Bernardin for over a
          decade, yet his philosophy and approach to wine is anything but
          pretentious. Imbued with Aldo’s insatiable passion and eagerness to
          teach others, Wine Simple is accessible, deeply educational, and
          lively and fun, both in voice and visuals.”

          about the world of wine and the author’s favorite recommendations are
          $25 or less. This pairs nicely with any recipe ;)
